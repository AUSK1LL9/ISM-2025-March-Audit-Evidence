**ISM-0488 Compliance Validation (Security Researcher Perspective)**

As a security researcher, validating compliance with **ISM-0488** involves a critical assessment of SSH connections that utilize passphrase-less authentication (e.g., key-based authentication without a passphrase). This control specifically mandates the use of the 'forced command' option and parameter checking to strictly limit what an authenticated user can do.

**ISM-0488 Reference:** "If using remote access without the use of a passphrase for SSH connections, the ‘forced command’ option is used to specify what command is executed and parameter checking is enabled."

This control aims to significantly reduce the risk associated with compromised SSH keys that lack a passphrase. By forcing a specific command and validating its parameters, an attacker who gains access to such a key is severely restricted in their ability to perform arbitrary actions, achieve lateral movement, or exfiltrate data.

Here are the TTPs you should employ to check and verify compliance with ISM-0488, including what to test and examine:

**I. Configuration Review (Primary Method)**

- **Tactic:** Secure Configuration Verification
- **Technique:** Directly examine SSH server configuration files (sshd_config) and, more importantly, the authorized_keys files for users utilizing passphrase-less SSH keys.
- **Procedure:**
    1.  **Identify Users with Passphrase-less Keys:**
        - Determine which user accounts on SSH servers have key-based authentication enabled without a passphrase. This often involves reviewing authorized_keys files for entries that _do not_ contain no-port-forwarding, no-X11-forwarding, no-agent-forwarding, no-pty, or no-user-rc if these are expected to be disabled by other controls. The key indicator for ISM-0488 is the _absence_ of a passphrase on the key itself.
        - **Examine:** Look for entries in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (or equivalent for other users) that correspond to keys without a passphrase.
    2.  **Verify 'forced command' Option:**
        - For every entry in an authorized_keys file that corresponds to a passphrase-less key, check for the presence of the command="&lt;forced_command&gt;" option at the beginning of the key's line.
        - **Examine:**
            - **Correct Example:** command="/usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC...
            - **Incorrect Example (Missing Forced Command):** ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC...
            - **Incorrect Example (Empty Forced Command):** command="",no-port-forwarding... ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC...
    3.  **Assess 'Specified Command' and 'Parameter Checking':**
        - This is the most critical and nuanced part of ISM-0488. The forced command itself must be a specific, well-defined script or executable, _not_ a general shell or a command that allows arbitrary input.
        - **Parameter Checking:** The forced command (the script or executable specified) _must_ implement robust validation of any parameters it receives. This prevents an attacker from passing malicious arguments to the forced command to achieve unintended actions.
        - **Examine the Forced Command's Code:** If possible and authorized, review the source code of the forced_command script/executable.
            - Does it validate all input parameters?
            - Does it use allow-lists for expected arguments?
            - Does it prevent shell injection (e.g., using exec with explicit arguments, not eval or direct shell execution of untrusted input)?
            - Does it prevent path traversal?
            - Does it run with least privilege?
        - **Examine sshd_config for ForceCommand:** While command= in authorized_keys is more common for per-key restrictions, ForceCommand in sshd_config applies to all logins for a specific user/group/match block. If used, ensure it points to a secure, parameter-checking command.
- **Examples:**
    1.  **Test (Configuration Review):**
        - On a Linux server, run grep -r "ssh-rsa" /home/\*/ .ssh/authorized_keys | grep -v "command=" to find passphrase-less keys without a forced command (this is a starting point, not definitive).
        - Manually inspect authorized_keys files for keys that lack a passphrase (e.g., ssh-keygen -y -f &lt;keyfile&gt; and check if it prompts for a passphrase).
        - If a command="/path/to/script.sh" is found, obtain script.sh and analyze its code for parameter validation.
    2.  **Examine (Configuration Findings):**
        - Finding: An authorized_keys entry for user_backup has ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC... with no command= option. **Violation.**
        - Finding: An authorized_keys entry has command="/bin/bash",no-port-forwarding... ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC.... **Violation:** /bin/bash is not a specified command with parameter checking; it's a full shell.
        - Finding: An authorized_keys entry has command="/usr/local/bin/file_retriever.py",no-pty ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC.... Upon reviewing file_retriever.py, it accepts a filename as an argument but does not sanitize it, allowing ../../etc/passwd as input. **Violation (Parameter checking not enabled).**

**II. Behavioral Testing / Attack Simulation**

- **Tactic:** Controlled Exploitation / Functionality Testing
- **Technique:** Attempt to bypass the forced command, execute arbitrary commands, or exploit parameter validation weaknesses.
- **Procedure:**
    1.  **Direct Command Execution Attempt:** Log in with a passphrase-less key that has a forced command. Try to execute a different command directly on the SSH client command line.
        - **Example:** ssh -i key.pem user@host "ls -la /" (if the forced command is df -h).
        - **Expected Result:** The SSH session should immediately execute the _forced_ command, ignoring ls -la /, or disconnect.
    2.  **Parameter Injection/Bypass:** If the forced command is a script, try passing malicious parameters to it.
        - **Example:** If the forced command is command="/usr/local/bin/get_log.sh", try ssh -i key.pem user@host "log_file; cat /etc/passwd" or ssh -i key.pem user@host "log_file && rm -rf /".
        - **Expected Result:** The forced command should either fail gracefully due to invalid parameters or execute only its intended function, without executing the injected commands.
    3.  **Shell Escape Attempts:** If the forced command unexpectedly drops into a limited shell or allows command execution, try common shell escape techniques (e.g., !bash, Ctrl+Z then bg then stty raw -echo; fg).
        - **Expected Result:** These attempts should fail or disconnect the session.
- **Examples:**
    1.  **Test:** For a user backup_user with a passphrase-less key and command="/usr/local/bin/run_backup.sh", attempt:
        - ssh -i backup_key.pem backup_user@server "whoami"
        - ssh -i backup_key.pem backup_user@server "/usr/local/bin/run_backup.sh; cat /etc/shadow"
    2.  **Examine:**
        - If whoami is executed instead of run_backup.sh, or if cat /etc/shadow executes, it's a **Violation**.
        - If the connection closes or the command fails as expected, it indicates compliance.

**III. Auditing & Logging**

- **Tactic:** Detective Controls
- **Technique:** Verify that SSH activity, specifically forced command execution and any bypass attempts, is logged and monitored.
- **Procedure:**
    1.  **SSH Log Configuration:** Ensure SSH server logging is enabled and configured for sufficient verbosity (e.g., LogLevel VERBOSE in sshd_config). This is crucial for capturing attempts to execute arbitrary commands.
    2.  **Log Collection:** Confirm SSH logs are sent to a centralized logging system (e.g., SIEM like Elastic Stack).
    3.  **Alerting:** Verify that alerts are configured for suspicious SSH activity, such as:
        - Attempts to execute commands other than the forced command.
        - Errors related to command execution or parameter validation.
        - Login attempts from unexpected source IPs (though this is more ISM-0487).
- **Examples:**
    1.  **Test:** Perform the behavioral tests from Section II (e.g., attempting to execute whoami when a forced command is active).
    2.  **Examine:** Check the SSH server logs (/var/log/auth.log on Linux) and the centralized logging system for entries related to the SSH session. Look for:
        - Confirmation that _only_ the forced command was executed.
        - Any error messages or warnings indicating that an unauthorized command or parameter was attempted.
        - Messages like "Forbidden command" or "Command not found" if the forced command logic correctly rejects invalid input.

By systematically applying these TTPs, a security researcher can thoroughly assess an organization's compliance with ISM-0488, specifically focusing on the secure implementation of 'forced commands' and robust parameter checking for SSH connections using passphrase-less authentication. Always ensure testing is performed within an authorized scope and all findings are meticulously documented.
